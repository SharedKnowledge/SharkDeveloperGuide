\section{Profile}
\label{sec:knowledgePorts:Profile}
Peers like Alice and Bob sometimes have more relevant information about themselves. If there is more than temporal interests an instance to store and collect theses relevant facts about peers is needed. Therefore we can use the profile. A profile can change its shape so it fits the needs. E.g. its possible to make an entry "ProfileName" and these entry can store a first name, a last name and a nick name but the entry can easily be changed so if there is no need for a nick name it can be changed into alternate spellings for the first name or add several new components to the "ProfileName" like academical titles and so on. An entry is a generic component of a profile. A profile can handle/hold.
